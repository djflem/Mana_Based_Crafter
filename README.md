A tool to help create manabases for MtG decks, EDH specifically. The user is prompted to input numbers to navigate the program. You can create a deck or load an existing deck. Once you have created or loaded a deck,
the user may then access a number of stastical charts. I intend to implement methods to view: probability of drawing a land, % of land to all cards, how many basic lands suggested for each color, and more...

Currently the decks are stored locally in a text file. My ultimate goal would be for this to become a Discord bot with easier user input and more beautiful charts.
